I learnt about what Basic version control is and git being an example of BVC.
I learnt the basic commands that is being used in git.
commands like:
git init ---used for initializing git in a repository
git clone --- used for cloning a remote repository to the local machine
git branch and checkout --- for checking out of an existing branch or creating a new branch
git status --- to check the changes made on a branch
git add --- to add a specific file or select all files
git commit --- to add a message commit the changes
git push -- to push to the remote repository
git fetch --- this is used to get all branches created
